Practice problems in the Eloquent JS Book by Marijn Haverbeke


## How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
Reading technical documentation has immensely improved my proficieny in Javascript. In addition to reading, coding along to the reading builds the muscle memory to implement all the powerful things learned. In this repo, I exercise my JS skills by completing all the practice problems in the chapter I've read of Eloquent JS.
